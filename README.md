# The-produser-consumer-problem
This project demonstrates a classic Producer-Consumer pattern in Java. The Producer generates tasks, the Consumer processes them, and the Printer displays progress. It highlights key concepts in concurrent programming like thread synchronization and safe data sharing, useful for understanding multi-threaded applications and resource management.
